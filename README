relpath


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

This program puts out the relative path of two files.


SYNOPSIS

relpath [PATH [PATH]]


INSTALLATION

This program requires the programs dirname, basename, realpath, and bash.

In order to install this program just run install-relpath.sh, which will
install the relpath executable and the library by symlinking to the files under
this directory. Alternatively, just copy the files into the right places.

If you would like to use relpath for your prompt, run install-prompt.sh which
will also install relpath and librelpath_ps1. Again, alternatively just open
the installer and do what it would do, manually.


USAGE

The relpath program can be called with two arguments that are paths to files or
directories. The output is the relative path from the first argument to the
second argument. Additionally, if the variable $RELPATH is set, relpath can be
called with one argument or no arguments, In this case, the value of the
$RELPATH variable is always taken as the source, and the value of the only
command line argument is taken as the destination. If the argument is missing,
the current working directory is used.

If the relative path would go through the file system root, the absolute path
is returned instead.

The librelpath_ps1 library can be used for your prompt ($PS1 in bash). To do
this you need to use the script from the installer, which sources the library
librelpath_ps1 and calls $(ps1path "\w") instead of \w. This then displays a
relative path just like in the home directory; except that it is relative to
the value of the environment variable $RELPATH. The prompt then uses = instead
of ~ as the prefix.


ENVIRONMENT

The variable $RELPATH can allow the program to be run with one and zero
parameters, which is described in the earlier sections of this document.


STABILITY

This program should be fairly stable. There can be speed improvements if it is
rewritten in C.
